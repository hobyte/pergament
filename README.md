This Plugin frees you from those chains. Write whatever you want in every Note. Enjoy the freedom of paper like note taking pared with the features of Obsidian. Quickly add some notes and embed them into your previous thoughts. Format them with different styles and colours or change the style to whatever you want.

## Motivation

Two things started the work on this plugin. I have my all my files synced on all my devices. And I like to write most of my notes by hand. My setup is an Android Tablet and currently Samsung Notes. I really like this app for handwritten notes, but theres no way to sync the notes with non Samsung device. As I use Obsidian on all other Devices, I wanted some way to organize my handwritten notes in Obsidian. It would be best, if I could the organization features of Obsidian with my handwritten notes. I tried other plugins like excalidraw, but most of them are made for Sketching and Diagramms and none of them fit my workflow. So I started to develop this plugin with the goal to bring handwritten notes to Obsidian.
